### BIOL 551/L Computer Modeling in Biology

**Author**: Sally Heo  
**Description**: This repository will be used during the Spring 2022 semester for **BIOL 551/L** to upload weekly assignments and projects. This repository is organized by week with subfolders that contain each week's **_Data_**, **_Scripts_**, and **_Outputs_**.  
**BIOL 551/L Repository**: [Spring 2022](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Spring-2022) 

## **Folders**:

* **Week_2**: As a class, we created our first simple script and learned how to import data using the class's repository.  
  * **_Data_**: [weightdata.csv](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Ha_Heo/blob/main/Week_2/Data/weightdata.csv) 
  * **_Scripts_**: [week2class.R](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Ha_Heo/blob/main/Week_2/Scripts/week2class.R) 
  * **_Outputs_**: N/A   
    
* **Week_3b**: We were introduced to **ggplot2** and learned how to make our first plot through ggplot2. In addition, we plotted the Palmer Penguins data in class and practiced making a plot. Below are the scripts used in class to generate the plot in class along with the lab assignment/homework due. The outputs folder contains the plots that were generated in class and for homework. 
  * **_Scripts_**: [week3b.R](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Ha_Heo/blob/main/Week_3b/Scripts/week3b.R), [week3c.R](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Ha_Heo/blob/main/Week_3b/Scripts/week3c.R), [Homework_Week_3.R](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Ha_Heo/blob/main/Week_3b/Scripts/Homework_Week_3.R)
